# Cylinder_Volume 
// Cylinder Volume = π r² h = π r² h

Finding out the volume of cylinder through a program that reads given diameter and height.

A can manufacturer wants to develop a program to calculate the cost of a cylindrical aluminum can, 
knowing that the cost of aluminum per square meter is R$ 100.00. 
Read the radius and height and write the cost value. 
Declare a constant for the value of PI and another for the square meter value.
